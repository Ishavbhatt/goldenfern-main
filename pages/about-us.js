                    Shimla is the capital of the northern Indian state of
                    Himachal Pradesh, in the Himalayan foothills. Once the
                    summer capital of British India, it remains the terminus of
                    the narrow-gauge Kalka-Shimla Railway, completed in 1903.
                    Itâ€™s also known for the handicraft shops that line The Mall,
                    a pedestrian avenue.
